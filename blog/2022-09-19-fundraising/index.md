### 38 server regions over the world

Many service providers share your server resources with other people,
so that they can only host at most ~5 servers over the world.
Meanwhile, `dstserver.cloud` run your server on a standalone machine.
So that, we sustain `38 regions` worldwide to deliver you the lowest latency.

### Native server and mod configurations

Have you ever tried to run a server, but it keeps crashing unexpectedly?
How about installing a mod that is a nightmare even for experienced players?
From now on, `dstserver.cloud` will handle that.
You can quickly try thousands of DST workshop items without studying them.

### Per minute payment

Imagine you want to play DST with your friend,
test a new workshop item,
play for a couple of hours a day and roughly 2-3 days a week.
But all the providers force you to buy a monthly subscription.

The `dstserver.cloud` can deploy/terminate the server in less than a minute.
Furthermore, the pay-per-minute model will save you tons of money.

| Payment mode | Pros                    | Cons                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Monthly      | Slightly cheaper        | Pay 1 month then play 3 hours 😪 |
| Per minute   | Stop playing anytime 😀 | Slightly cost more               |

### Web-based server monitoring

We help you manage the servers without opening the game.

- Check CPU/RAM usage
- send messages to players
- Rollback/regenerate
- Kick griefers
- Real-time logs tracing

### Anti griefers

The `dstserver.cloud` maintains a blacklist to keep your servers from griefers.
Moreover, you can contribute by reporting them, too.

### Containerize

Other providers use container to quickly develop, test and deploy the servers.
However, it eats up your RAM and slow down your machine.
Meanwhile, `dstserver.cloud` run your game directly on Linux OS.
As a result, booting time reduces from 5 minutes to less than 1 minute.

### Scheduling for auto start/stop

Create schedules to start the server when you play and stop when you sleep.

## Budget usage

This section describes how we use the money to develop the `dstserver.cloud`.

### Testing

To bootstrap a product, testing is the most important, even in early phases.
Although cloud services are convenient, launching and testing cost is high.
On the other hand, the `dstserver.cloud` use `Sentry.io` to log errors.
