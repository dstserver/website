### 38 server regions over the world

Many game hosting providers force you to share resources with other people on a big server so that they can only host at most ~5 servers over the world. Meanwhile, [dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud) let you run a DST server on a standalone machine with `38 regions` over the world to make sure that you will get the lowest latency and highest performance possible.

### Native server and mod configs

Have you ever tried to run a simple DST server but it keeps crashing without any further information? How about installing a mod that is a nightmare even for experienced players?

Don't worry, [dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud) will handle that. Now you can quickly try thousands of DST workshop items without studying them.

### Per minute payment

Sometimes you want to quickly start a server to play with your friend, test out a new workshop item, and play for a couple of hours a day, roughly 2-3 days a week. But all the hosters force you to buy a monthly subscription.

Now [dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud) allows you to quickly deploy/terminate the server in less than a minute and the pay-per-minute model will help you save tons of money while you can still try new stuff.

| Payment mode      | Pros                    | Cons                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Monthly subscribe | Slightly cheaper        | Pay 1 month then play 3 hours 😪 |
| Pay per minute    | Stop playing anytime 😀 | Slightly cost more               |

### Web-based server monitoring

[dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud) help you manage all of your servers without opening the game. You can check CPU/ram usage, send messages to players, rollback, regen, and kick griefer via the web.

Also, you can trace logs via the web to identify suspicious behaviors and potentially prevent griefers.

### OMGGGG Griefer!!!

[dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud) shares and maintain a blocklist with other groups so that you can mitigate the risk that your base getting burnt.

More important, you will be able to report griefer, too.

### Containerize

Many hosters use container technology to quickly develop, deploy and test their servers. However, it eats up your RAM to hundreds of MB and makes your server run slower than a native machine.

With [dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud), we deploy your game server directly on Linux OS without any level of containerization or resource-sharing.
Furthermore, by avoiding containerization, the server booting time reduces from ~5 minutes to < 1 minute.

### Scheduling for auto start/stop

You can create a schedule to start the server at `5:00 PM` when you come home and stop the server at `midnight` when all your gang to go sleep.

## Budget usage

This section describes how would we use the funding money to develop [dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud).

### Testing

For any SaaS product bootstrapping, testing is the most important step, especially in the early phases.

Although cloud technology is quite efficient and convenient, the cost of launching and testing game servers using the cloud is not cheap.

[dstserver.cloud](https://dstserver.cloud) leverage the advancement of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) to auto-report crashing on the client-side.
